\begin{abstract}
    In this work we will present a simulation of a naval enviroment's internal networking
    using the AFXDP technology.
    In particular, our implementation written in the Rust programming language,
    enhances security and performance through the language's main characteristics
    such as memory safety, zero-cost abstractions and performance-critical suitability.
    The software that will be discussed in this work is capable of fast packet processing
    skipping the Linux network stack by redirecting packets in the user-space enviroment.
    There the developer gains complete expressive power over the data allowing any manipulation possible over the received packets such as filtering, redirecting, blocking and editing.
    Furthermore, the simulation handles data conformed to actual marine electronic devices communication protocols making it suitable as drop-in replacement for modern infrastructures
    without requiring additional hardware nor introducing new communication standards. 
    We will also test our simulation against the state-of-the-art solution showing
    a much better result retaining the same performance.
