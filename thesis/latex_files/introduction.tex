\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% \ernote{a sample note}
% This is a template for the Master Theses at DIBRIS,
% University of Genoa. It uses the \xspace{\LaTeX} class \texttt{masterthesis.cls} by
% Davide Ancona. We will use this template to discuss what is generally expected in the
% structure of a Master Thesis. While reading academic documents, you will find that
% they generally follow a similar structure.
%
% This structure is generally good for research documents, in which your main goal is to do
% something new. In other cases (e.g., the goal of your thesis is to review a topic and provide
% an understanding of the field), a different structure may be more desirable. In any case,
% discuss the structure of your thesis with your advisor.
%
% We are writing a scientific document, and we should take into account that skepticism
% is at the core of the scientific method. We should be skeptical of our own work, and
% we can see the thesis as an effort to persuade a skeptical reader that we have done
% a piece of work that is both useful and solid.
%
% When writing your document, don't try to reach a given number of pages. Instead, try to make it
% \emph{complete}, \emph{clear} and \emph{concise}. Try to give all the information that will
% convince the reader that your work is solid and that you have done a good job; use simple
% language and consistent terminology.\footnote{Don't overuse footnotes. By the
% way, notice that they should be put after punctuation as in this case.}
% If you can say something in a simpler way, do it.
% Consider that your reader will be a fellow computer scientist, but not necessarily an expert
% of your specific topic. Try to give them the information they need to understand your work, but
% do not lose your reader's time and attention with unnecessary details.
%
% Documents like this generally follow a structure like this one. It is not a strict
% requirement, but it is a good idea to follow it, as readers will find it easier to navigate it.
% Consider that in scientific documents some readers will not read the whole document,
% but will look for specific pieces of information. A clear structure will help them.
%
% Chapters generally start with a short introduction, where the reader is introduced to the topic
% of the chapter. This is followed by the main content of the chapter, and then by a conclusion
% that summarizes the main points of the chapter. Note that both chapter and section titles are
% \href{https://www.grammarly.com/blog/capitalization-in-the-titles/}{capitalized}.
%
% Be extremely wary of large language models (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT or Copilot). You take
% responsibility for the content of your thesis, and declare you have written it yourself.
% If you want a tool that helps you to write in better English, consider using something like
% \href{https://grammarly.com}{Grammarly}; it is also supported by the
% \href{https://www.overleaf.com}{Overleaf} online \latex editor.
%
% \section{Motivation}
%
% The motivation is the first important thing that you should write in your Introduction.
% You can see it as the effort to convince your reader that the problem you are addressing
% \emph{matters}. You should mention that the problem is unsolved, but you will discuss that at
% length in the Related Work section (\Cref{sec:related}, in this template). Consider that
% you're facing a skeptical reader who is asking ``is this useful?''.
%
% In some cases it will be obvious why the problem matters, but in other cases, this will be
% one of the most delicate part of your work. Of course, your advisor will help you with this.
%
% \section{Content of the Thesis}
%
% The other main goal of the Introduction is to give the reader an overview of what they will
% find in the document. There is no concept of ``spoiler'' in scientific documents: summarize
% what the reader will find in every part of the document. This will help them to navigate it
% (and to find what they're interested in, if they are reading the whole document).
%
% \section{\latex Tricks}
%
% If you're using \latex to write your document, you can use some tricks to make your life
% easier. This document uses the \verb|\Cref| command to reference sections, figures, and tables conveniently, and \verb|\textcite| and
% \verb|\authorcite| to cite paper authors. You can also use \verb|\xspace| to define your macros
% and avoid spacing problems. Check the source code to see how they are used.
%
% \texttt{rubber} is a good tool to compile \latex documents. You can run the command
% \texttt{rubber -d main} to compile this document to PDF, while running \texttt{pdflatex}
% and \texttt{biber} (or \texttt{bibtex}) the right number of times.
%
% The \href{https://www.overleaf.com}{Overleaf} online editor is a good tool to synchronize with
% your advisor; it exports a git repository so that you can use it both online and offline.

\section{Motivation and Context}
The motivation behind our effort is trying to provide a drop-in solution to Operational Techonlogy (OT) systems' main problem : internal networking.\\
OT systems  are hardware and software solutions that monitor 
and control physical devices, processes, and infrastructure in industrial environments.\\
The aforementioned are characterized by a internal communication structure that is completely \textbf{unrestricted, unfiltered and omnidirectional} thereby facilitating uninhibited behavior within the network.
Finding a solution to this problem results in a particularly hard task because of OT systems' nature :
\begin{itemize}
	\item The composition is characterized by the presence of \textbf{legacy code}, the optimization of which can be a laborious and time-consuming process that necessitates a considerable investment of resources
    \item The communication protocols used are entirely devoid of any encryption mechanism, thereby rendering information exchange remarkably \textbf{vulnerable and unreliable}
    \item The implementation of substantial modifications is not a straightforward process, as they are \textbf{static assets} that play a crucial role of fundamental systems that are indispensable to our daily lives
\end{itemize} 

Leveraging these characteristics such solution should be \textbf{retrocompatible, transparent and should not introduce additional overhead}.

\section{Goals}\label{sec:goals}

The goal of this work is to implement a simulation of a OT Naval system which leverages a Layer7 software switch with the following features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item should be agnostic to the underlying software and hardware of the running architecture with the ability to be integrated seamlessly into existing infrastructures;
    \item should be capable of abstracting OT systems' components leveraging also policy rules that regulates communication among them;
    \item should preserve normal communication flow for messages that do not conform to "National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA)";
    \item should be able to process, filter and drop NMEA sentences considering policy rules previously defined;
    \item preserve or enhance legacy solutions' performances
\end{itemize}

\section{Content of the thesis}
The first topics presented are relevant background information (\autoref{ch:background}) of Naval Networks and Protocols, Software Defined Networking and the underlying technologies of the L7-Switch, EBPF and AFXDP.\\
Next the Switch's architecture and functionalities will be analyzed (\autoref{ch:method}) discussing the normal packet flow and the filtered one.\\
Following implementation choices will be reviewed (\autoref{ch:implementation}) exploring the 
decisions behind the project's structure and pondering the resulting performances (\autoref{ch:evaluation}).
Lastly a selection of existing works and proposed solutions will be presented considering fundamental aspects of each one (\autoref{ch:related}).
