\section{OT Security overview}
In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to modernize and fortify critical maritime OT infrastructures. This initiative has given rise to the development of cybersecurity campaigns and directives, which have in turn identified opportunities to enhance the management of control systems and network operations. These are comprised of a set of rules and procedures that aim to raise awareness of potential cyber risks as well as to define the behaviors that are to be adopted, identifying the human factor as the most significant vulnerability, as stated in a serie of articles and online resources such as \cite{industry_approach}, \cite{securing_maritime}, \cite{maritime_decision_makers}, \cite{cyber_preparedness}.

Although solutions that do not necessitate additional software or hardware appear to be the prevailing preference with a notable emphasis on personnel training the necessity of a technical response to this threat has been underscored as well: \cite{integrated_ship_cybersecurity}.

The modern industry is shaped by innovative concepts and technologies that aimed towards interconnectedness facilitated by machine-to-machine and machine-to-control system communications. Keeping this in mind critical challenges in securing OT systems were born needing solutions that prioritized availability, integrity and confidenciality.

Moreover, the integration of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) infrastructures within contemporary architectural frameworks has unveiled a plethora of previously unacknowledged vulnerabilities and threats. This integration has led to an augmentation of complexity and interconnectedness, thereby expanding the attack surface significantly. In light of these developments, the necessity for novel risk assessment methodologies has become apparent to ensure the proper security of infrastructures.

Within the domain of OT systems, two primary methods have emerged: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative assessment prioritizes individual risks based on the probability of their occurrence, whereas quantitative assessment analyzes risk numerically by assigning it a numerical value. 
Presently, the preponderance of maritime physical risk assessments is rooted in probability statistics.

The development of a qualitative risk assessment framework for cyber risks in maritime environments poses significant challenges. The scarcity of data, attributable to the limitations of reporting abilities and the novelty of this emerging risk, contributes to the volatility of maritime cyber data, making reliable probability estimation challenging. 

In addition to the aforementioned points, the measurement of cyber risk has been conducted on numerous occasions in a variety of sectors and their systems. However, there has been a paucity of such studies in the maritime sector, which has been estimated to be approximately two decades behind cyber-security trends. The unique systems, protocols, and the movement across physical and cyber spaces mean that traditional methods of risk assessment cannot be easily applied without modifications to existing infrastructures. The unique blend of these factors create a distinct maritime risk landscape that can result in outcomes such as loss of finance, loss of life, and environmental damage.

\section{Hardware Solutions}
In consideration of the interconnection among components, the principal vulnerability in this approach is identified in the communication channel. Consequently, it is hypothesized that an attacker can gain access to the network and identify vulnerabilities in the process controlled by a system component. The proposed solution to this problem is the implementation of intrusion detection systems of variable complexity, which necessitate the integration of additional hardware components within the existing infrastructure whose purpose would be to analyze network traffic seeking potential attack patterns. The work published in the article \cite{fog_ids} will be taken as example for the following considerations.
