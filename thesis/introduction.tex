\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% \ernote{a sample note}
% This is a template for the Master Theses at DIBRIS,
% University of Genoa. It uses the \xspace{\LaTeX} class \texttt{masterthesis.cls} by
% Davide Ancona. We will use this template to discuss what is generally expected in the
% structure of a Master Thesis. While reading academic documents, you will find that
% they generally follow a similar structure.
%
% This structure is generally good for research documents, in which your main goal is to do
% something new. In other cases (e.g., the goal of your thesis is to review a topic and provide
% an understanding of the field), a different structure may be more desirable. In any case,
% discuss the structure of your thesis with your advisor.
%
% We are writing a scientific document, and we should take into account that skepticism
% is at the core of the scientific method. We should be skeptical of our own work, and
% we can see the thesis as an effort to persuade a skeptical reader that we have done
% a piece of work that is both useful and solid.
%
% When writing your document, don't try to reach a given number of pages. Instead, try to make it
% \emph{complete}, \emph{clear} and \emph{concise}. Try to give all the information that will
% convince the reader that your work is solid and that you have done a good job; use simple
% language and consistent terminology.\footnote{Don't overuse footnotes. By the
% way, notice that they should be put after punctuation as in this case.}
% If you can say something in a simpler way, do it.
% Consider that your reader will be a fellow computer scientist, but not necessarily an expert
% of your specific topic. Try to give them the information they need to understand your work, but
% do not lose your reader's time and attention with unnecessary details.
%
% Documents like this generally follow a structure like this one. It is not a strict
% requirement, but it is a good idea to follow it, as readers will find it easier to navigate it.
% Consider that in scientific documents some readers will not read the whole document,
% but will look for specific pieces of information. A clear structure will help them.
%
% Chapters generally start with a short introduction, where the reader is introduced to the topic
% of the chapter. This is followed by the main content of the chapter, and then by a conclusion
% that summarizes the main points of the chapter. Note that both chapter and section titles are
% \href{https://www.grammarly.com/blog/capitalization-in-the-titles/}{capitalized}.
%
% Be extremely wary of large language models (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT or Copilot). You take
% responsibility for the content of your thesis, and declare you have written it yourself.
% If you want a tool that helps you to write in better English, consider using something like
% \href{https://grammarly.com}{Grammarly}; it is also supported by the
% \href{https://www.overleaf.com}{Overleaf} online \latex editor.
%
% \section{Motivation}
%
% The motivation is the first important thing that you should write in your Introduction.
% You can see it as the effort to convince your reader that the problem you are addressing
% \emph{matters}. You should mention that the problem is unsolved, but you will discuss that at
% length in the Related Work section (\Cref{sec:related}, in this template). Consider that
% you're facing a skeptical reader who is asking ``is this useful?''.
%
% In some cases it will be obvious why the problem matters, but in other cases, this will be
% one of the most delicate part of your work. Of course, your advisor will help you with this.
%
% \section{Content of the Thesis}
%
% The other main goal of the Introduction is to give the reader an overview of what they will
% find in the document. There is no concept of ``spoiler'' in scientific documents: summarize
% what the reader will find in every part of the document. This will help them to navigate it
% (and to find what they're interested in, if they are reading the whole document).
%
% \section{\latex Tricks}
%
% If you're using \latex to write your document, you can use some tricks to make your life
% easier. This document uses the \verb|\Cref| command to reference sections, figures, and tables conveniently, and \verb|\textcite| and
% \verb|\authorcite| to cite paper authors. You can also use \verb|\xspace| to define your macros
% and avoid spacing problems. Check the source code to see how they are used.
%
% \texttt{rubber} is a good tool to compile \latex documents. You can run the command
% \texttt{rubber -d main} to compile this document to PDF, while running \texttt{pdflatex}
% and \texttt{biber} (or \texttt{bibtex}) the right number of times.
%
% The \href{https://www.overleaf.com}{Overleaf} online editor is a good tool to synchronize with
% your advisor; it exports a git repository so that you can use it both online and offline.

\section{Motivation}

In this work we deal with the problem of simulating a primary radar,
with a focus on maritime radars. The motivation behind this effort is
to provide an efficient and flexible radar simulator, able to achieve
real-time performances, which can be used for the testing of the radar
system, assisting its design, analysis,
 and evaluation and for the training of personnel. 
Additionally, the output of the simulation can be used as training set 
for a machine learning model as a cost-effective alternative to
real world measurements.
While many solutions already exist, they either suffer from 
inadequate performances or from simplifications of certain
propagation effects of the EM waves, for example ignoring 
multipath propagation.


\section{Goals}\label{sec:goals}

% \glnote{Sviluppo per punti di cose di cui il nostro modello tiene conto}

Goals of this work is to implement a radar simulator with the following features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item simulation of monostatic and bistatic radars;
	\item parametrized radiation pattern, so that the simulator can accept data from real world measures;
	\item physically based and parametrized materials;
	\item realistic propagation, including multipath propagation;
	\item simulation of Doppler shift;
	\item dynamic environment, with the ability to update continuously the
		position of the various objects in the simulated environment;
	\item real-time performances and continuous execution of the simulation, with
		the ability to integrate into other systems with ease.
\end{itemize}

\section{Content of the thesis}

We start by presenting the relevant background information (\autoref{ch:background})
about the working of a primary radar,
the physics of EM waves,
and the Vulkan API, used in this work.
Then we briefly present a selection of existing work (\autoref{ch:related}).
We later detail the features, architecture and implementation of the radar simulator
at the core of this work (\autoref{ch:method}).
Lastly, we discuss how this work compares to a selected existing
work in terms of performance and simulation accuracy together
with qualitative results  (\autoref{ch:results}).
