\label{ch:conclusion}

% You are finally done! Here you will summarize for the reader what you have taught them through
% the document, and what are the main takeaways of your work you would like them to remember.

% It is also a good idea to discuss the limitations of your work and your views about what can be
% possible future work.

In this work we showed how a radar simulator based on the shooting and bouncing
ray method can be implemented efficiently on commodity GPU hardware by
leveraging the ray accelerators present in the recent generations of GPUs. We
tested our implementation against state of the art simulation software, showing
that we get similar results while achieving significantly better performances.
Furthermore, our implementation, being based on Vulkan, can be run on any
combination of operating systems and hardware vendors. In addition, we
presented an approach to the ray generation to ensure low angular separation,
i.e.~high ray density, in the region of high gain of the antenna used by the
radar, while maintaining the radiation pattern general.

A possible extension to this work is to increase the fidelity of the
simulation by including effects not yet considered in this work, such as the
polarization of the EM waves transmitted by the antenna and propagated in the
environment or the simulation of atmospheric attenuation caused by rain and fog.
